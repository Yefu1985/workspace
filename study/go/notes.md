# Study Notes of GoLang for Beginners
## Introduction
This is a self studying notes of GoLang especially for a beginner. It will contain all the example codes, the
studying materials.

The study of coding usually involve two parts: theory and practise. Never spend too much time in theory study, and
never try to understand everything in one time. It is suggested to go through the theory relatively faster. The more
details can be learnt by practise. The aims of practise are 1. understand the theory better; 2. become more
proficient in the skill. 
  
In addition, there are too many studying materials for almost all IT related topics. This is definitely a double-edge
sword: 1. easier to get a lot of materials; 2. too many materials to pick up. Based on my personal experience, I
often found I saved a lot of courses; unfortunately, I rarely went through them completely. It was more normal for
me to just learn some basic ideas, such as "introduction" part multiple times, and never got a chance to dive
deeper. The reason is normally common: hard to follow up and understand. So, I think it is better to write down
and record anything you have mastered. By practising and making notes, the study efficiency can be enhanced
significantly. 

For GoLang study, here are the contents and materials I have tried:

## Part I: Basic Knowledge of Go
1. The official [Go Tutorial](https://tour.golang.org/): you can have a first impression of Go by this tutorial. If
you happen to have some coding experience, it would be super easy. 
2. The official [Go Documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/): it is highly recommended to save this in your bookmark
, because it contains the official documentation for all the basic packages in Go. 

After completing the first tutorial, for sure, there will be a lot of confusions and questions, never mind. Just please
go to make more practises. 

## Part II Basic Data Structures
### BuiltIn Data Structures
There are three types of data in Go:

1. Basic:
    * numbers: int, unint,(8, 16, 32, 64), float (32, 64), byte(8), rune(int32, or say char)
    * boolean (8)
    * string
2. Aggregate:
    * array
    * struct
3. Reference:
    * pointer
    * slice
    * map
    * functions


### Other Common Data Structures

## Part III Basic BuiltIn Packages
### ioutils
### time & date
### data format: json, csv, avro, protobuf
### logger
### database:sql
### regex
### testing
### modules

## Part IV Other Utilities
### Package and Project Management
### Cloud Components: AWS, GCP
### Container:Docker
### Dashboard:Grafana
